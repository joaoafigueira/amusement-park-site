# Amusement-park-site -- Select Language:  **English**, [PortuguÃªs]()
Diversion is a amusement park website created for the purpose of: 

- Automate ticket sales;
- Control of customer information.

On the Back-end i built the site in MVC pattern using Java, with data connection using JDBC.

In Front-end I used java script, html, css and Jquery.
